SUMMARY = "pytest plugin to abort hanging tests"
DESCRIPTION = "This plugin will time each test and terminate it when it takes too long. Termination may or may not be graceful, please see below, but when aborting it will show a stack dump of all thread running at the time. This is useful when running tests under a continuous integration server or simply if you donâ€™t know why the test suite hangs."
